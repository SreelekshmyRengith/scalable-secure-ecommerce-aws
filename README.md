# Scalable and Secure E-commerce Platform on AWS

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a scalable, secure e-commerce platform leveraging AWS services. It showcases best practices in infrastructure setup, application security, content delivery, and performance optimization.

---

## Project Overview

The e-commerce platform architecture utilizes key AWS services to ensure scalability, security, and performance:
- **Auto Scaling and EC2**: Scalable compute resources to handle dynamic traffic.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Secure and reliable database management.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protection against SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **CloudFront CDN**: Efficient global content delivery, reducing latency.

---

## Key Phases of Implementation

### 1. **Infrastructure Setup**
- Used AWS CloudFormation to deploy:
  - **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with public and private subnets.
  - **Internet Gateways** and **Security Groups** for secure networking.
- Configured **EC2 instances** and **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to manage incoming traffic and ensure secure HTTPS communication.

### 2. **Application Security**
- Deployed **AWS WAF** with custom rules to prevent security threats like SQL Injection and XSS.
- Managed domain routing with **Route 53** and secured communication using **SSL certificates** via **AWS Certificate Manager**.

### 3. **Content Delivery and Performance Optimization**
- Implemented **CloudFront CDN** to cache static and dynamic assets, ensuring fast response times globally.
- Enhanced performance through:
  - **GZIP Compression**.
  - Custom cache configurations to minimize load times.

### 4. **Testing and Monitoring**
- Conducted load testing using **JMeter** to simulate high traffic scenarios.
- Monitored system performance using **AWS CloudWatch**, tracking metrics like:
  - CPU usage.
  - HTTP request latency.
- Configured alerts for proactive identification and resolution of unusual activity.

## Architecture Design

- Built on a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** for secure isolation.
- Distributed resources across multiple **Availability Zones** for high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Auto Scaling Groups** dynamically adjust the number of **EC2 instances** based on traffic demand.
- **RDS** ensures secure, reliable database management with encryption.

## Conclusion and Future Improvements

This project demonstrates the use of AWS managed services to build a scalable and secure e-commerce platform. The architecture ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and protection against common security threats.

### Proposed Improvements:
1. Reduce Auto Scaling cooldown periods for faster instance scaling.
2. Introduce **Predictive Scaling** for proactive resource allocation.
3. Add **ElastiCache** to further enhance performance by reducing database load.
